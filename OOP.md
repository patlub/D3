## Object-Oriented Programming

Relationships between classes help us know how objects can relate to each other. The most common relationships in Object-Oriented Programming are: 

### Encapsulation
The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.

### Abstraction
Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers make changes and additions over time more easily.

### Inheritance
Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.

### Polymorphism
Objects are allowed to take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down on the need to duplicate code.
